\subsection{Code, Data, and Reproducibility}

Benchmarking experiments were performed on [redacted for double-blind review]'s High Performance Computing Center, a cluster of hundreds of heterogeneous x86 nodes linked with InfiniBand interconnects.
For multithread experiments, benchmarks for each thread count were collected from the same node.
For multiprocess experiments, each processes was assigned to a distinct node in order to ensure results were representative of performance in a distributed context.
All multiprocess benchmarks recorded from the same collection of nodes.
Hostnames are recorded for each benchmark data point.
For an exact accounting of hardware architectures used, these hostnames can be crossreferenced with a table included with the data that summarizes the cluster's node configurations.

Code for the distributed graph coloring benchmark is available at \url{https://github.com/mmore500/conduit} under \\ \texttt{demos/channel\_selection}.
Code for the digital evolution simulation benchmark is available at \url{https://github.com/mmore500/dishtiny}.
Exact versions of software used are recorded with each benchmark data point.
Data is available via the Open Science Framework at \url{https://osf.io/7jkgp/} \cite{foster2017open}.
An in-browser notebook for all reported statistics and data visualizations and is available via Binder at \url{https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mmore500/conduit/HEAD?filepath=binder\%2F} \cite{jupyter2018binder}.
