\subsection{ Digital Evolution Benchmark } \label{sec:digital_evolution_benchmark}

The digital evolution benchmark runs the DISHTINY (DIStributed Hierarchical Transitions in Individuality) artificial life framework.
This system is designed to study major transitions in evolution, events where lower-level organisms unite to form a self-replicating entity.
The evolution of multicellularity and eusociality exemplify such transitions.
Previous work with DISHTINY has explored methods for selecting traits characteristic of multicellularity such as reproductive division of labor, resource sharing within kin groups, resource investment in offspring, and adaptive apoptosis \citep{moreno2019toward}.

DISHTINY simulates a fixed-size toroidal grid populated by digital cells.
Cells can sense attributes of their immediate neighbors, can communicate with those neighbors through arbitrary message passing, and can interact with neighboring cells cooperatively through resource sharing or competitively through antagonistic competition to spawn daughter cells into limited space.
This cell behavior is controlled by SignalGP event-driven linear genetic programs \citep{lalejini2018evolving}.
Full details of the DISHTINY simulation are available in \citep{moreno2021exploring}.

We use Conduit-based messaging channels to manage all interactions between neighboring cells.
Conduit models messaging channels as independent objects.
However, support is provided for behind-the-scenes consolidation of communication along these channels between pairs of processes.
Pooling joins together exactly one message per messaging channel to create a fixed-size consolidated message.
Aggregation joins together arbitrarily many messages per channel  to  create a variable-size consolidated message.

During a computational update, each cell advances its internal state and pushes information about its current state to neighbor cells.
Several independent messaging layers handle disparate aspects of cell-cell interaction, including
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cell spawn messages, which contain arbitrary-length genomes (seeded at 100 12-byte instructions with a hard cap of 1000 instructions). These are handled every 16 updates and use Conduit's built-in aggregation support for inter-process transfer.
  \item Resource transfer messages, consisting of a 4-byte float value. These are handled every update and use Conduit's built-in pooling support for inter-process transfer.
  \item Cell-cell communication messages, consisting of arbitrarily many 20-byte packets dispatched by genetic program execution. These are handled every 16 updates and use Conduit's built-in aggregation support for inter-process transfer.
  \item Environmental state messages, consisting of a 216-byte struct of data. These are handled every 8 updates and use conduit's built-in pooling support for inter-process transfer.
  \item Multicellular kin-group size detection messages, consisting of a 16-byte bitstring. These are handled every update and use Conduit's built-in pooling support for inter-process transfer.
\end{itemize}

Implementing all cell-cell interaction via Conduit-based messaging channels allows the simulation to be parallelized down to the granularity, potentially, of individual cells.
However, in practice, for this benchmarking we assign 3600 cells to each thread or process.
Because all cell-cell interactions occur via Conduit-based messaging channels, logically-neighboring cells can interact fully whether or not they are located on the same thread or process (albeit with potential irregularities due to best-effort limitations).
An alternate approach to evolving large populations might be an island model, where Conduit-based messaging channels would be used solely to exchange genomes between otherwise independent populations \citep{bennett1999building}.
However, we chose to instead parallelize DISHTINY as a unified spatial realm in order to enable parent-offspring interaction and leave the door open for future work with multicells that exceed the scope of an individual thread or process.
